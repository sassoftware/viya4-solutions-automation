# Configure Git for SAS Model Publish Service

## Overview

The Model Publish service uses the sas-model-publish-git dedicated PersistentVolume Claim (PVC) as a workspace. 
When a user publishes a model to a Git destination, sas-model-publish creates a local repository under /models/git/publish/, which is then mounted from the sas-model-publish-git PVC in the start-up process.

## Files

In order for the Model Publish service to successfully publish a model to a Git destination, the user must prepare and adjust the following file that are located in the `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/sas-model-publish/git` directory:

**storage.yaml**
  defines a PVC for the Git local repository.

The following file is located in the `$deploy/sas-bases/overlays/sas-model-publish/git` directory and does not need to be modified:

**git-transformer.yaml**

  adds the sas-model-publish-git PVC to the sas-model-publish deployment object.

## Installation

1. Copy the files in the `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/sas-model-publish/git` directory to the `$deploy/site-config/sas-model-publish/git` directory. Create the target directory, if it does not already exist.

   **Note:** If the destination directory already exists, [verify that the overlay](#verify-overlay-for-the-persistent-volume) has been applied. 
   If the output contains the /models/git/ mount directory path, you do not need to take any further actions, unless you want to change the overlay parameters for the mounted directory.


2. Modify the parameters in storage-git.yaml. For more information about PersistentVolume Claims (PVCs), see [Persistent Volume Claims on Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims).

   * Replace {{ STORAGE-CAPACITY }} with the amount of storage required.
   * Replace {{ STORAGE-CLASS-NAME }} with the appropriate storage class from the cloud provider that supports ReadWriteMany access mode.
   
3. Make the following changes to the base kustomization.yaml file in the $deploy directory.

   * Add site-config/sas-model-publish/git to the resources block.
   * Add sas-bases/overlays/sas-model-publish/git/git-transformer.yaml to the transformers block.
   
   Here is an example:
   
   ```yaml
   resources:
   - site-config/sas-model-publish/git
   
   transformers:
   - sas-bases/overlays/sas-model-publish/git/git-transformer.yaml
   ```
  
4. Complete the deployment steps to apply the new settings. See [Deploy the Software](http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyml0phy0dkr&docsetTarget=p127f6y30iimr6n17x2xe9vlt54q.htm) in _SAS Viya: Deployment Guide_.

   **Note:** This overlay can be applied during the initial deployment of SAS Viya or after the deployment of SAS Viya.
   
   * If you are applying the overlay during the initial deployment of SAS Viya, complete all the tasks in the README files that you want to use, then run `kustomize build` to create and apply the manifests. 
   * If the overlay is applied after the initial deployment of SAS Viya, run `kustomize build` to create and apply the manifests.

## Verify Overlay for the Persistent Volume

1. Run the following command to verify whether the overlays have been applied:

   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod  <sas-model-publish-pod-name> -n <name-of-namespace>
   ```
   
2. Verify that the output contains the following mount directory paths:
    
   ```yaml
   Mounts:
     /models/git
   ```
