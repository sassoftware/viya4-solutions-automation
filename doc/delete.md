## Delete Deployment

To delete the deployment, go to Azure portal and locate the `mapp-<ID>-rg` resource group, then request the deletion of that resource group.
This will delete the `mapp-<ID>-rg`, `mapp-<ID>-mrg` and `MC_mapp-<ID>-mrg-mapp-<ID>-aks_<Location>` resource groups.

**IMPORTANT**: This action is **irreversible**.
